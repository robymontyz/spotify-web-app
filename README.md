# Spotify Web App

Simple Apple Automator workflow to quickly open Spotify Web Player site in Google Chrome. It will look like the official app, just without the useless rubbish.

*It uses Chrome instead of Safari because the latter doesn't support Google's Widevine DRM component yet.*

## Installation

* Make sure to have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed.
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/robymontyz/spotify-web-app/releases)
* Copy `Spotify.app` in `/Applications`
* Right-click on `Spotify.app` and, while holding `cmd` key, select `Open`
* Click `Open`
* Enjoy!

## Building

* Clone the repository or download it
* Open `Spotify.workflow` with Automator
* Make your changes
* Go to `File -> Convert To... -> Application -> Choose`
* In the new window go to `File -> Save... -> Choose a name -> Change file format to Application -> Save`
* Done!

You can use `Spotify.icns` as the app icon. Just follow [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201737).
